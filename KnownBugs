Known bugs:

Fix wall glitch in the new house downstairs - you can kinda walk/go through one of the walls in one of the houses.
“Any interesting rumors?” can be asked again upon quest completion. It should only be asked once, before the quest is started/completed.

I don't know how to fix these yet, but I am looking into it.

Not a bug, but as of now, followers cannot enter the home. I will look into a solution for this too.
