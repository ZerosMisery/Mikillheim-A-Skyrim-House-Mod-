You will need Hearthfire and Update.esm
This is my very first mod. I am super inexperienced and have no idea what I’m doing. Keep this in mind.

Description: When I was younger, father gave me a house in Hjaalmarch’s woods; Mikillheim, a home originally built by my ancestors. His last gift to me, I accepted it – finally, I’d have my own place. Some weeks after his death, I began my move from my childhood home to the house he left me.

When I got to the door, I questioned whether I was in the right place or not. Though there aren’t many houses in Hjaalmarch hold outside of Morthal, this house was … off. It was clearly old, but very unkempt at best – the lawn alone grew up to my knees, and upon opening the door and looking inside, the interior was no better. I stared into the kitchen and pots, baskets, even paper cluttered the floors; food was still left on the table and below that, a bedroom with hoards of things all over the floor that I couldn’t make out.

I considered turning around at that point, abandoning the place. But instead, I placed my pack down on the floor and wondered how I alone would go about cleaning the house up.

This mod includes:
-	A cursed/haunted house.
-	A short storyline (non-linear?), only available through multiple letters and some environmental storytelling. (There aren’t map markers on all of the letters – you will need to find them).

Mikillheim is a very simple, short exploration/quest mod, using a vanilla Skyrim house model and turning it into a custom home (or two) with a haunted backstory. The story of the house is told entirely through multiple letters and journals – only **one** of which having a map marker (the rest, you have to search for).

The quest is short. Seriously. Take your time, look for the (many) letters before you head to the quest marker. 

Hint: Using console commands (TCL) in an inaccessible area may help you progress through the house without needing to lockpick. 

How to start:
Go to Moorside Inn in Morthal, speak to Jonna and ask for “any interesting rumors”. She will hand you a letter. Reading it triggers the quest.

If you want the backstory on the house: there will be a letter on the countertop, “Letter to Jarl Idgrod”. No need to give the letter to the jarl or do anything else with it. This letter should also trigger the quest.
